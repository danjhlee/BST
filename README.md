Binary Search Tree

Following is a definition/condition of a BST:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than node's key
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys larger than node's key
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees

In the implementation of BST, following functions are implmented using C progrmaming language:
- Inserting a node to a BST and deleting a node from a BST
- Finding minimum and maximum elemets in a BST
- Printing elements of a BST
- Check whether a tree is a BST or not
- Finding successor and predecessor of a given node in a BST
- Finding kth smallest element in a BST utilizing successor
- Finding kth largest element in a BST utilizing predecessor
- Finding a Lowest Common Ancesor of two elements in a BST
